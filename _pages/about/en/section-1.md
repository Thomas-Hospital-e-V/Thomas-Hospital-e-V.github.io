### The Kinderhilfe & St. Thomas Hospital Association in Cameroon

The FÃ¶rderverein Kinderhilfe und St. Thomas-Hospital in Kamerun e.V. (Children's Aid and St. Thomas Hospital Association in Cameroon) was founded in 2000. It supports education and upbringing as well as the care of sick and needy people in Cameroon.

Our organization is recognized as a non-profit; it has branches in Germany, Cameroon, and France.

We are pleased that we exclusively employ local staff on-site. However, specialists from abroad are always welcome to provide practical help in Cameroon.

Conversely, it is important to us that our African employees have the opportunity to gain an impression of our training in Europe through guest visits.

All European members work on a voluntary basis, without expense allowances or compensation. There are no administrative costs.
