Pot. N°164/2021/A

Ebolowa, November 2021

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, dear Friends!

I am pleased to use the Feast of Christ the King to send you warm greetings from my homeland – combined with a short report on the projects of our association.

I am happy and grateful that our facilities have remained stable despite the global pandemic, even if the new investments that were actually planned have to be postponed somewhat.

I am very pleased that the Mvam-Zamba school was extensively renovated or expanded with new buildings this year. Furthermore, 6 teachers teach 130 children from the first to the 6th grade.

There are currently 7 children living in the Mvam-Zamba orphanage, cared for by 2 nuns. They are also supported by the villagers, who help cultivate the community's vegetable and fruit garden.

The Mvam-Zamba health station continues to be run by a nurse and a laboratory assistant; in addition, a cleaning lady is employed. Of course, the medical management is still in the hands of Dr. Elise, who comes to the village 1 to 2 times a month for the more seriously ill patients.

We are also proud of our vocational school in Nsimalen: In the meantime, 40 young people are being trained here in the fields of carpentry, masonry, electrical installation, and sewing. We are very grateful that we were able to purchase a large number of sewing machines, tools, and other equipment with your donations. This means that the young people can complete their training here with a recognized journeyman's certificate.

The St. Thomas Hospital in Nsimalen is also developing very well. In the meantime, we have been able to treat more than 1000 patients every month. We are particularly pleased that we can provide the urgently needed medication to the poorest patients free of charge.

A total of 23 people are now employed in the hospital: 4 doctors, 12 nurses, 2 laboratory assistants, 3 cleaning staff, and 2 security guards.

In my diocese of Ebolowa, the construction of the Hildegard-Althaus-School has made good progress. The building shell is almost complete and is already being used for teaching. So far, only children who can make the daily journey to school can be taught here. Those children who live further away in the jungle without transport connections will depend on accommodation in the boarding school.

I am particularly pleased to write to you about our guesthouse, which is generously financed by Prof. Thomas Reich. The construction work is also progressing steadily here, and I look forward to being able to accommodate my guests here well and safely. I fully expect your visit!

If at all possible, in addition to the ongoing expenses, we are planning to purchase an X-ray machine for the St. Thomas Hospital next year, which will probably cost €60,000. If we are very lucky, the completion of the sleeping rooms and sanitary facilities of the Hildegard-Althaus-School would be a matter of great concern to us.

But first of all, I thank you from the bottom of my heart on behalf of all the employees, the orphans and the sick, and - last but not least - the many students - for your friendship and loyal support!

May God bless and protect you!
