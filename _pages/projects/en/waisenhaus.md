## Orphanage

Currently, approximately 12 children are cared for by a responsible nun. Like in any Cameroonian family, the children here also have important tasks:

They cultivate the garden, take care of the chickens, and fetch water from the well. They are supported in this by the village community.

School and the infirmary are available to all children free of charge!
