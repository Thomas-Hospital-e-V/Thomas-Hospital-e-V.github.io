Travel Report of the Supporting Association

On August 22nd of last year, Celina and I embarked on our big trip to Cameroon together. After two flights and countless minutes of delay, we finally arrived in Ébolowa, the capital of the South Region of Cameroon.

For our almost six-month stay, Philippe, Bishop of the Diocese of Ébolowa and also representative of the supporting association here in Cameroon, provided us with accommodation or rather an entire floor on the premises of the Diocese.

After overcoming the initial culture shock and gradually settling in a bit, we went to Kribi with Pastor Bruno for three days. The coastal town, about 2 hours away from Ébolowa, offers not only paradisiacal beaches and small, dreamy fishing villages but also incredibly delicious fish. The fish is caught from the Atlantic Ocean with small wooden boats and freshly prepared directly on the beach. You can then enjoy the grilled fish with fried plantains or Bâton de Manioc on the beach while watching the sunset.

After three days on the most beautiful beach in the world, we returned to Ébolowa on adventurous routes through the deep bush of Cameroon, where we finally began our internship, the actual reason for our trip.

The internship started for us on Monday morning at 7:00 a.m. at College Bonneau, a Catholic private school of the Diocese, not far from our house. This day began like every Monday with the weekly flag salute and a speech by the headmistress. Seeing almost all 60...

...Abang complex, which consists of the primary school where we completed our internship and an adjacent kindergarten, and the Nko'vos complex, we have already donated a new playground through collected donations. Hopefully, it will be completed before our departure in February and can be inaugurated by us here on site.

The children's joy at just the news that a new playground would soon be there was immense. As was their joy when we gave the primary school new soccer balls. We were able to finance these with the help of donations as well. The purchase of the balls and the renovation of the two playgrounds was a good start to keep the kindergarten children occupied all day and the primary school children during breaks. However, this is far from sufficient, as the need for play equipment is really high and, as mentioned, lacking in almost all complexes.

Therefore, it would really be a matter of the heart for us to gradually purchase toys, balls, soccer goals, but also outdoor games to give the children something to do and bring them joy.

To realize this project, however, we depend on your donation or the help of the supporting association. Every donation, no matter how small, helps to support and implement projects like this and thus do something good for others.
