Cameroon is located at the crossroads of West and Central Africa. Its north-south stretch crosses various vegetation and climate zones: from the rain-drenched coastal lowlands with vast rainforests, through the central highlands, to the desert-like dry zones in the north. Since it combines many of the landscape and cultural features of the entire continent in a small area, Cameroon is also known as "Africa in miniature."
