Ebolowa, November 18, 2023

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, dear Friends!

On the Feast of Christ the King 2023, I send you warm greetings from Ebolowa. This year, I was able to spend almost 2 months in Rome on the occasion of the Ad Limina visit of the Cameroonian bishops and the subsequent World Synod. I was happy to experience our universal church so vibrantly and - in the meantime - to enjoy your warm hospitality in Fulda.

Despite the economic situation burdened by so many wars worldwide, I can report to you on a healthy development of our projects.

In the bilingual boarding school we founded, the Hildegard-Althaus-School, 310 boys and girls are now taught. In my homeland, where there is an increasing conflict between the English and French-speaking parts of the country, we also make a very concrete contribution to mutual understanding and peace through bilingual education.

We are very grateful that this grammar school also enables children who live scattered far and wide in the bush and mostly come from poor families to attend school.

The...

... a radiologist, an internist and a dentist regularly work as consultants at St. Thomas Hospital. In addition, we employ a total of 16 people as nurses, in the pharmacy, the laboratory and as security personnel.

We are very happy that we can offer a solid supply of medical care to the sick with a well-equipped laboratory and the new ultrasound machine. However, we are still dependent on generous donations for the purchase of an X-ray machine...

Sister Silvie and Dr. Elise look back with particular gratitude on their visit to Fulda this summer. For Sister Silvie - the headmistress of the Catholic grammar school in Ebolowa - it was her first visit to Europe, while Dr. Elise has found something of a second home in Fulda as part of the regular professional exchange.

For us Cameroonians, it is a particularly beautiful and very enriching experience to be able to travel and get to know your home...

Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your hospitality, without which such an undertaking would never have been possible!

Finally, I send you heartfelt thanks and greetings from all our employees, especially from Dr. Elise and Sr. Silvie, as well as, of course, from the children, young people and patients entrusted to us.

I trust that we will see each other again soon and in good health! God bless and protect you!

With all good wishes for a Merry Advent season,

Msgr. Dr. Philippe Alain
