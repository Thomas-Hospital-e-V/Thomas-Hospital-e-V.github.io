B.P: 910 Ebolowa - Cameroon L'EVEQUE

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, dear Friends!

On the Feast of Christ the King 2022, I send you very warm greetings from Cameroon, combined with great thanks for your loyal friendship.

Despite the effects of the Corona pandemic and the effects of the Ukraine war, which are also being felt here, I can report on a very good development of our projects.

The primary school in my home village of Mvam-Zamba was open throughout the last year. Thanks to your financial support, we were able to replace the 3 original and now very dilapidated school buildings in the village with new buildings in 2021. A total of 146 children are taught here by 6 teachers - I am very pleased that we do not have to charge any school fees.

There are currently 12 children living in the Mvam-Zamba orphanage, who are cared for by a foster mother. They continue to benefit from free attendance at the neighboring elementary school. The village community helps with the cultivation of the kitchen garden, so that a basic supply of food is guaranteed.

The village well built with your help is regularly maintained and functions reliably. The clean water available here is a real blessing, especially for our young children - they can now grow up healthier and...

... and washrooms are being built for the boarding school students. Currently, 332 boys and girls are taught at the Hildegard-Althaus-School; it is planned for 1000 students.

For the children in my diocese, who mostly live scattered far and wide in the bush, the large school bus donated by the Reich family is the only available means of transport - and indispensable for attending school!

The Thomas Reich Guesthouse - as you already know - has been completed for more than 1 year. Here I can accommodate my visitors very comfortably, so I would like to extend a heartfelt invitation to Ebolowa to all of you.

I look back with particular gratitude on my visit to Fulda this summer, where you welcomed and spoiled me in so many ways. A real highlight for me was our joint mass after the beautiful association meeting on June 25th - I felt like I was in a big family.

Finally, I send you heartfelt thanks and greetings from all our employees, especially from Dr. Elise (who is planning a visit to Fulda for the coming year), as well as, of course, from the children, young people and patients entrusted to us.

I trust that we will see each other again soon and in good health!

God bless and protect you!

With all good wishes for a Merry Advent season,
