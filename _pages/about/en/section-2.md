We are pleased that we exclusively employ local staff on-site. However, specialists from abroad are always welcome to provide practical help in Cameroon.

Conversely, it is important to us that our African employees have the opportunity to gain an impression of our training in Europe through guest visits.

All European members work on a voluntary basis, without expense allowances or compensation. There are no administrative costs.
