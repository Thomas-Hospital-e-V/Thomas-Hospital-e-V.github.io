The Hildegard Althaus Lyceum is currently still in its construction phase but is already being used for teaching. This bilingual school owes its existence to the generous legacy of our patron and friend Hildegard Althaus. The boarding school enables children living deep in the jungle to receive a school education despite the lack of transport connections.
