## Infirmary

Hospitals only exist in the big cities and are only accessible to the richest. Our infirmary in the village of Mvam-Zamba ensures basic medical care for the poor.

It includes an examination room, a small laboratory, a pharmacy, and sanitary facilities. 2 hospital rooms enable the care of even the seriously ill and bedridden patients. Complicated cases are transferred to the St. Thomas Hospital in the capital Yaound√©.

The infirmary employs 2 nurses, 2 laboratory technicians, a pharmacist, and 2 cleaning staff. Once a week, there are doctors' rounds for the serious cases.
