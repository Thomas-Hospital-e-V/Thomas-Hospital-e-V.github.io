# Cameroon
---

#### Diverse Cameroon

Cameroon lies at the intersection of West and Central Africa. Due to its north-south extension, it cuts through a wide variety of vegetation and climate zones: from the rainy coastal lowlands with huge primeval forests to the central plateau and the desert-like dry zones of the north.

Due to its geographical diversity, Cameroon is also known as "Miniature Africa."

#### Health

Diseases such as polio, hepatitis, typhus, malaria, and worm infections can be transmitted through contaminated water. Mortality is alarmingly high, especially among children. HIV infection is spreading at an increasing rate. As a result, the tuberculosis rate is dramatically increasing.

#### Education

A good school and vocational education is often an unaffordable luxury in West Africa. Public schools are repeatedly closed due to stagnant salary payments. The costs for a private institution must be borne independently; many families cannot finance this.

#### Mvam-Zamba

In the middle of the rainforest, about 70 km south of the capital Yaoundé, lies the village of Mvam-Zamba. The people there live mainly from agriculture and hunting. Due to a lack of prospects, more and more young people are migrating to the big cities; often the old and the poorest remain behind.

Our association started its first aid projects here in 2002, initially with the construction of a well and a water tower. This significantly improved the health status in the village:

The well construction has greatly reduced the infection rate in children with hepatitis (jaundice) and parasites (e.g., worms!).

#### Nsimalen / Yaoundé

Due to its close proximity to the international airport, Nsimalen has a very good infrastructural location. Here, we were able to inaugurate our vocational school in 2013, followed in 2016 by the commissioning of the St. Thomas Hospital in the immediate vicinity.

#### Ebolowa

Since 2016, our coordinator in Cameroon, Dr. Philippe Mbarga, has been the Bishop of Ebolowa, which is located in the south of the country. As a result, our activities have naturally expanded into his new area of responsibility.
