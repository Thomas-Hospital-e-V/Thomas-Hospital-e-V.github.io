## Elementary School

School attendance at our Mvam-Zamba elementary school is free for all children. Classes take place in 3 small buildings. The school building was inaugurated in 2004 and renovated in 2020 by the village community through their own efforts.

We employ 6 teachers to teach approximately 120 children.

School attendance lasts 6 years. Afterward, the children have the opportunity to attend our vocational school. Fetching water and helping with agriculture are also among the students' regular duties.
