Before our hospital in Yaoundé can be inaugurated, another container is to be sent on its way to Dipperz – if possible, with the basic equipment for the laboratory. Since there is still a lot to be purchased for this, we are still dependent on financial support.

In this context, I am particularly pleased to introduce you to my colleague Dr. Bana (or Dr. Elise) from Cameroon.

Dr. Elise is a nun with the "Daughters of Mary," and Pastor Philippe has succeeded in recruiting this well-trained and capable doctor to head our hospital in Yaoundé. To do this, he had to negotiate tenaciously with the Superior General of the community; after all, doctors in Cameroon are very valuable workers due to their expensive training and the small number of study places – Dr. Bana is the only doctor in her congregation.

Sister Elise is currently visiting Germany for 3 months. She has made good use of the time for a language course to be able to coordinate the long-term planned aid missions in Cameroon with the German helpers in the future. As a doctor, I have already benefited from her knowledge and experience regarding the medical conditions in West Africa, and I am very grateful that we were able to win over this competent and selfless helper.

## Dr. Elise was warmly welcomed by everyone

In addition to the many people who met my colleague with warm hospitality, I would especially like to thank my parents at this point, who accepted Dr. Elise as their youngest daughter during the first six weeks of her stay in Germany and made her a little familiar with Fulda.

## At the motherhouse of the Vincentian Sisters

The loving welcome that Dr. Elise subsequently received from the Vincentian Sisters in the motherhouse was also a real enrichment for us. Here, Sister Philea, who has a lot of experience through the long-standing exchange of religious women with India, made a great personal effort to ensure that our guest gained a broad insight into our healthcare system and elderly care and felt truly safe, as in a large family.

In return, Elise was a dear, open-minded, and uncomplicated guest who greatly enriched our community and taught us a lot about her African home.

## Departure

In ten days, my colleague will return to her home, and we wish her much strength and God's blessing for her responsible service in our new hospital.

One thing is certain for all of us who have gotten to know her here and were allowed to have her with us: She is a real stroke of luck, humorous, intelligent, very practical, and absolutely reliable!
