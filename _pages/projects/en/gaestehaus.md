The initiative for a pastoral guesthouse came from our founding member, Prof. Thomas Reich. Thanks to the generous support of Prof. Thomas Reich, the very comfortable guesthouse has now been completed and is available to our visitors.

The faithful in Ebolowa, along with the bishop, are delighted with a centrally located, truly beautiful place for personal encounters, which also provides good and safe accommodation for guests from Europe.
