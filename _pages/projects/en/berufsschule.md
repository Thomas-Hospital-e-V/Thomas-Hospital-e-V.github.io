## Vocational School

A particular concern of our association is the training of young people to enable them to have an economic livelihood in Cameroon. Our vocational school in the capital Yaoundé houses a carpentry workshop and a sewing workshop.

The products made here significantly finance the remuneration of our African employees. The carpentry workshop was and is also significantly involved in the furnishing of the St. Thomas Hospital.

School uniforms and work clothes are made in the sewing workshop. In the vocational schools, young people receive a solid education and are prepared to run their own small business later.
