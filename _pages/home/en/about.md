### Children’s Aid & St. Thomas Hospital in Cameroon

The Children’s Aid and St. Thomas Hospital in Cameroon Association was founded in 2000. It supports education and upbringing as well as the care of sick and needy people in Cameroon.

Our organization is recognized as non-profit; it has branches in Germany, Cameroon, and France.

We are pleased that we exclusively employ local staff on-site. However, experts from abroad are always welcome if they wish to offer practical help in Cameroon.

Conversely, it is important to us that our African staff have the opportunity to experience our education system in Europe through guest stays.

All European members work on a voluntary basis, without reimbursement for expenses or allowances. No administrative costs are incurred.
