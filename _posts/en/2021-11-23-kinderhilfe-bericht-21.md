Dear members, dear friends!

We are very pleased to send you Bishop Philippe's New Year's greetings, combined with a short report on the Fulda association's activities in the waning year of 2021.

Unfortunately, the traditional association meeting in the Dompfarrzentrum had to be canceled this summer due to the pandemic restrictions.

However, Bishop Philippe was able to visit Fulda in September for 3 weeks despite the associated uncertainties and strict conditions (quarantine, tests before flights, etc.). So, in the end, a formal association meeting with him and a minimal number of participants was possible.

We gratefully remember the beautiful mass that Bishop Philippe celebrated with us for all the living and deceased members of our association on September 24th in the Heilig-Geist-Kirche. We experienced how good the friendly encounters and conversations afterward were for all of us. In any case, we have decided to include the annual joint service permanently in our association program in the future!

Naturally, the local community activities have been severely restricted due to the Covid-19 regulations. We are all the more pleased that we have gained a man in our new member, Mr. Leslie Scheuber, who has rebuilt our technically outdated website against some tough resistance. We were helped by our long-time friend Thomas Vogler, who has been creating and maintaining our website on a voluntary basis. The contact with the start-up company "matters.dev" came about through Thomas, and they have taken on the really complex technical support very committedly and at cost price. We are particularly proud of the perfect English translation, which two good friends of Leslie (David and Silvia Usbeck from Leipzig) contributed.

For the coming year, in addition to maintaining the facilities already in operation, we have set ourselves two ambitious projects:

The completion of the accommodation for the external students of the Hildegard-Althaus-School and the purchase of an X-ray machine for the St. Thomas Hospital. To put it in a nutshell, there are no upper limits to our association's need for donations!

We close our letter with all good wishes for the upcoming Advent and Christmas season.

Thank you for your friendship and loyal support!

Kind regards,

Petra Leinweber & Marion Fuhrmann
