The hospital in the capital Yaoundé has 60 beds. We are pleased to have Dr. Elise, a competent and dedicated head physician, who is expertly supported by Dr. Agnes.

The friendly and collegial exchange between African and European employees is very important to us.

We repeatedly find how important the tropical and general medical knowledge of the Cameroonian colleagues is for good therapy. The maternity and postnatal ward significantly minimizes the risk for delivering mothers. In addition, there is an ambulance for accident victims.
