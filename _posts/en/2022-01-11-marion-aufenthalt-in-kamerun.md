Ebolowa, January 7, 2022

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, dear Friends!

I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all a Happy New Year and send you warm greetings from Ebolowa in southern Cameroon today. I am currently spending a truly inspiring time with Bishop Philippe during the Christmas holidays and am happy to report on the progress of our projects here in West Africa.

Immediately after my arrival, I was able to visit our vocational school in Nsimalen / Yaoundé and present 10 graduates with their journeyman's certificates after successfully passing their final exams. As in previous years, the occasion was celebrated in a corona-compliant but very joyful manner – the families of the happy graduates were visibly happy and grateful.

When selecting our vocational school students, Bishop Philippe mainly considers those from poor families who have suffered severe blows of fate such as illness, death, or serious accidents. It is easy to imagine that children and young people in such cases are very much threatened by real poverty here in Cameroon.

I was particularly pleased that 2 former students gave an impressive public testimony during the celebration...

...Dr. Elise treats approximately 1000 patients, especially children and mothers, but also numerous births and many accident victims. If necessary, specialists are consulted for the therapy: a gynecologist, a surgeon, an ophthalmologist, and a dentist regularly hold consultations.

The number of sick people seeking help is increasing rapidly here, so the purchase of the relatively expensive medicines and laboratory supplies continues to represent a major cost factor.

Since Bishop Philippe wrote us a very detailed report 5 weeks ago, I can be brief here - and finally, convey a big thank you from Cameroon for your diverse friendly and material support. We hope that Bishop Philippe (and perhaps also Sr. Dr. Elise) will be able to visit us again this summer…

I am happy to pass on the warm greetings from Bishop Philippe, Sister Dr. Elise Bana, all employees, students, and patients to all of you.

With all good wishes,

I remain cordially and gratefully yours,

Marion Fuhrmann
