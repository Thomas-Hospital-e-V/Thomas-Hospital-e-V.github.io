Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, dear Friends,

I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all a Happy New Year and send you warm greetings from Ebolowa in southern Cameroon. I am currently spending an inspiring time here with Bishop Philippe during the Christmas holidays and would like to update you on the progress of our projects here in West Africa.

Immediately after my arrival, I had the pleasure of visiting our vocational school in Nsimalen/Yaoundé, where I presented 10 graduates with their journeyman certificates following their successful final examinations. As in previous years, the occasion was celebrated joyfully while adhering to COVID regulations – the families of the happy graduates were visibly pleased and grateful.

When selecting students for the vocational school, Bishop Philippe especially considers those from poor families who have suffered severe hardships, such as illness, death, or serious accidents. It is easy to imagine that children and young people in such cases here in Cameroon are severely threatened by true destitution.

I was particularly delighted that two former students gave impressive public testimonies during the celebration. The two young men warmly thanked Bishop Philippe and our association for their education and contributed enthusiastically to the success of the event through humorous moderation and musical performances.

I am also pleased to report on the completion of the Thomas Reich Guesthouse, where visitors to the diocese can now be comfortably accommodated. The building is located very close to the Bishop’s residence and is furnished very comfortably. So you can accept Bishop Philippe’s invitation to visit his diocese without any worries!

At the beginning of 2022, we visited the Hildegard Althaus School here in Ebolowa. The construction of this bilingual boarding school is thanks to our long-time companion and friend Hildegard, who generously supported the association with a foundation after her death. The shell of the school building is now completed. Currently, 139 students are being taught in 4 classes. For the coming year, Bishop Philippe plans to set up dormitories and medical rooms for the external students, as well as construct a well with a water tower. The boarding school represents a major opportunity for young people living far out in the bush. Without any transportation links, these children otherwise have no possibility of attending school.

I can also report good progress at the St. Thomas Hospital. Thanks to a new generator, the hospital now has a continuous electricity supply, which also benefits the heavy equipment in our carpentry workshop (which was often incapacitated by the previously unreliable public power supply). The building for the planned radiology unit has been completed — however, acquiring the expensive radiology equipment remains a major financial challenge for us.

Last year, Sister Dr. Elise treated about 1,000 patients, mainly children and mothers, but also handled many births and numerous accident victims. When needed, specialist doctors are brought in for particular treatments: a gynecologist, a surgeon, an ophthalmologist, and a dentist regularly hold consultations.

The number of sick people seeking help is increasing rapidly, making the procurement of the comparatively expensive medications and laboratory supplies a significant ongoing cost factor.

Since Bishop Philippe wrote us a very detailed report five weeks ago, I will keep this update brief — but I would like to send you a heartfelt thank you from Cameroon for your diverse friendship and material support. We hope that Bishop Philippe (and perhaps also Sr. Dr. Elise) will be able to visit us again this summer.

I am pleased to pass on warm greetings from Bishop Philippe, Sister Dr. Elise Bana, all staff, students, and patients to all of you.

With best wishes,  
I remain warmly and gratefully yours,
